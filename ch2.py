#Problem 2.1

#basic continuity, momentum, energy equations for flow across oblique shock waves (ex 4)
#deriv equations 2.6 and 2.8

#is there a python capablity to derive equations for us? 

#u2 and v2 are velocity components behind shck parallel and perpendicular to the upstream velocity.
#(not parallel and perpendicular to shock wave, as is usally taken in most standard shock wave derivations)
